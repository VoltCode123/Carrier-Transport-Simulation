# Carrier Transport Simulation  
**A MATLAB-based simulation of charge carrier transport in semiconductors, incorporating drift, diffusion, and real-time visualization.**

## 📌 Overview  
This project simulates **1D carrier transport** in a semiconductor under an applied electric field. It models **electron and hole drift, diffusion, and concentration changes** over time. The simulation provides real-time **animated visualization** of carrier behavior in different semiconductor materials (**Si, GaAs, Ge**).
